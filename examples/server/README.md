# Example Server
This is a toy server that illustrates how to use the parquetjs library built with esbuild.
To run it: 
1. npm install
1. View and edit the files in `views` to taste   
1. node app.js
1. Build and serve the parquetjs bundle in the main parquetjs directory: `npm run serve`    
1. visit `http://localhost:3000` and click buttons, do things in the console.
